Miranda Brooks is a landscape architecture who needed an effortlessly simple-to-update website to showcase her work. With design by Alizee Freudenthal, we developed the website that puts images of her gardens front and center. Siteleaf is used as a content management system to allow the slideshows to be updated season to season.
