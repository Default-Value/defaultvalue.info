We worked with MICAâ€™s Architectural Design department to produce a simple department manual that they could print themselves on-demand as needed. The book is meant to give current and prospective students an overview of the department, courses, and degree plan. By emphasizing images of student work we show the diversity of project outcomes and the personality of the department.

We designed the book to accommodate changes in the department from year to year, such as updating courses, descriptions, faculty, and student work. The transparent cover image and title sticker can be swapped out to easily recognize the current version.
